Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors—they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.",

Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures of each.",

Called to serve powers beyond most mortal understanding, all priests preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of their people. Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these emissaries of the divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms and the magic of their gods. Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing and redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and corruption. The ways of the cleric are varied, yet all who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the arms of the gods themselves.",

Their true strength lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase their own and their allies’ prowess in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need. As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion—such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge—free of a deific abstraction.

While his repertoire of effects is small, he has little or no limits on the amount of times he can use them. Warlocks are chaotic creatures at heart, perhaps as a result of the wild magical energy that courses through their veins. They tend to be selfish and don’t work well in a rigid command structure. While understanding the need to stay within a group, the warlock won’t hesitate to leave the group to pursue something interesting. Warlocks generally adventure for curiosity or profit. A warlock’s infusion with magical power often manifests in minor cosmetic changes to their appearance that fosters a sense of wrongness about them. A human warlock might have catlike eyes, while a dwarven warlock may be hairless. Warlocks tend to be solitary, preferring to be left alone rather than join in camaraderie. Warlocks come from varied backgrounds. It is not known how or why the magic picks them; it just does. A common thought is that the warlock has aberration, elemental, fey, or outsider blood in his veins. Many warlocks are driven out of their communities and left to fend for themselves (leading to many scholarly debates about “nature v s . nurture” in regards to the warlock’s allegiance to chaos). Warlocks are found amongst all races, but are most common in races that produce sorcerers. This lends some credence to the “alien ancestor” theory. Most warlocks are human or half-elf, although there are large numbers of gnomish and half-orcish warlocks as well.",
