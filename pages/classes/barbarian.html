            For some, there is only rage. 
            In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, 
            conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious 
            martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriorsâ€”they are the battle 
            possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers 
            know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, 
            with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. 
            They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. 
            These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though 
            whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians 
            storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.
